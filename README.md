My personal scripts for converting my CD's to FLAC and then to MP3s.  This is not 100% automated yet.  It should be, but it is not as I was doing a lot of hand holding for my older CDs.

Buy your music and support the artists.  If you buy plastic CD's, you can keep them nearly forever as long term storage of your music in case of data loss.
